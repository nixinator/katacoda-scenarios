Nix-shell lets you open a shell in a new environment.

In Nix; an environment is a collection of derevations (aka packages) that are put into your PATH. This is really useful in many circumstances:

Collaboration; you can just send the .nix file to a collaborator and they will have the same things installed


Cleanliness; stuff inside a nix-shell isn't installed in your main environment; so you don't have to worry about uninstalling stuff or causing conflicts with other packages you love


Developing things; it is easy to build your own packages and test them inside a shell
