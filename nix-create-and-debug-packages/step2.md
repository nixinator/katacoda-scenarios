How to install from a git local repository


##Â Task

Lets shallow clone directly from the distribution repo and set an environment variable pointing to it.

If we do a full clone, it can be quite large download as  the repo gets many commmits a day and 
also contains many branches.


`mkdir -p ~/tmpdev && cd ~/tmpdev`{{execute}}

`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs`{{execute}}

`export NIXPKGS=~/tmpdev/nixpkgs`{{execute}}

`ls $NIXPKGS`{{execute}}


example: list all available software from the local repository $NIXPKGS

`nix-env -f $NIXPKGS -qaP '*'`{{execute}}

you can also use nix search to get a friendly output
the -u flah is need to rebuild the cache from you newly downloaded nixpkgs repo

`nix search -u -f $NIXPKGS minecraft`{{execute}}

example: install software from local repository

`nix-env -f $NIXPKGS -iA python-urlgrabber`{{execute}}

example: build an expression and put the output into you present working directory

`pwd`{{execute}}

`nix-build $NIXPKGS -A irssi`{{execute}}

the results of this build is create in the /nix/store however a hand result symbolic link
is create for you.

``ls -la result``{{execute}}


example: get an environment which is used to build irssi (also see nix-shell)

`nix-build $NIXPKGS --run-env -A irssi`{{execute}}

example: get a persistent environment which is used to build irssi

`nix-build $NIXPKGS --run-env -A irssi --add-root`{{execute}}
